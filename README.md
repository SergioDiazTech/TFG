# TFG - Big Data & Natural Language Processing on Twitter

This repository is dedicated to tracking and version control for the TFG (Trabajo de Fin de Grado) project focused on Big Data and Natural Language Processing on Twitter.

## Project Overview

In today's digital age, the significance of the internet and social media in communication and public opinion analysis cannot be overstated. This holds particularly true during large-scale events such as civic protests, sports events, or political gatherings. One of the key dimensions of analysis in such scenarios is the geographical location of users and their opinions. However, obtaining geolocation information from social media data can be challenging due to the absence of geotags in many posts. To address this challenge, we propose the development of a system capable of extracting and representing geographical references from Twitter posts. This system will leverage a dataset comprising nearly 3,000,000 documents associated with social protest events in Spanish-speaking countries.
